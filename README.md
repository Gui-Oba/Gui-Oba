  - 📈 For my work in Data Analysis and Machine Learning, see **FIAM-Final**
  - 🖌️ For design work I did for my university club, explore **Hack4Impact-McGill-Website**
  - 🥇 For a **1st place** project at McGill AI Society's Hackathon, see **MAIS-2025**
  - 📚 For some school projects involving Java and OOP, check out **PantryPal** and **BlockGame**
<!--
**Gui-Oba/Gui-Oba** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
